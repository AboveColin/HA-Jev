"""What the house looks like to Assist.

Only entities the user exposed to Assist are described here. That boundary is the
user's, not ours: they already decided which entities a voice assistant may see, and
a spoken command is not a reason to widen it.

This applies to the voice path alone. The four service actions send whatever the
caller targets, exposed or not, because an automation names its entities on purpose.
