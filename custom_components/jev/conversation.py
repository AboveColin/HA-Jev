"""A conversation agent that routes spoken commands through Jev.

What this does that a sentence matcher cannot: it understands a command that was
not phrased the way the template expected. What it does that an LLM agent does not:
it runs one typed request, costs a fraction of a cent, and hands back a confidence
figure the router can refuse to act on.

Three things shape the design.

The house it sees is the Assist exposure list and nothing wider. The user already
decided which entities a voice assistant may touch.

Every command it understands runs a built-in intent, not a service call. Intents
carry Home Assistant's own matching, its own spoken responses in every supported
language, and its own permission checks. Reimplementing that would mean
reimplementing it worse.

Anything it is not sure about goes to the fallback agent whole, with no partial
action taken first. A voice assistant that half-acts is worse than one that says
it did not understand.
